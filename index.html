										As an M.Sc. student at Mila - Québec AI Institute and Université de Montréal, I currently hold a visiting researcher position at ServiceNow. 
										My past experience includes an internship at EPFL and AI research roles at companies. 
										I've earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science from Sharif University of Technology.
									  <br>
										My scientific interests center on understanding how intelligence is grounded in computation, specifically developing agents capable of reasoning in complex situations.
										I'm also dedicated to bringing AI solutions to real-world decision-making problems and collaborate with startups seeking to integrate AI into their systems.  
									  <br>    
										I am not committed to or against the development of artificial general intelligence for its own sake, but rather envision the creation of machines that can assist us in addressing and solving our problems.
										Furthermore, I strongly advocate for an active exploration of the ways in which AI shifts power dynamics and fundamentally transforms our world.

									<h2>About</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I am a master student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/">Mila</a> (Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute), in collaboration with <a href="https://davidrolnick.com/">David Rolnick</a>. 
									My research projects are focused on deep learning theory. I am particularly fascinated by the geometrical analysis of deep ReLU networks and
									the optimization challenges in machine learning. <br>
									
									My academic journey experiences have been began with Sharif University of Technology and my 
									research area was on studying the problems on Computational Biology, and Statistical Inference about biological problems. 
									My background is further enriched by a Minor in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology. I was honored to work with
									Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rKDtrNgAAAAJ&hl=en">Hamid Reza Rabiee</a> for several years on
									lots of interesting projects, for instance one with collaboration with UNSW university of Austrailia with collaboration with 
									Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=mQj8WS4AAAAJ&hl=en">Hamid Alinejad-Rokny</a>. <br>

									Beyond academics, I am an active participant in various extracurricular activities, 
									including teaching and mentoring roles. My diverse interests, ranging from working out, tennis and hiking 
									to music, add a unique perspective to my professional endeavors.

						<h2>Research Experiences</h2>
					</header>
					<ul>
						<li> 
							<h3>Symmetries of Deep ReLU Networks</h3>
							This ongoing research explores the function spaces of deep ReLU networks, focusing on uncovering
							architectural symmetries. The project is a collaborative effort with 
							Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/eli-grigsby/home">Elisenda Grigsby</a> and Dr. <a href="https://www.kathrynlindsey.com/">Kathryn Lindsey</a> 
							from the Mathematics Department at Boston College.
						</li>
						<li> 
							<h3>Reverse-Engineering Deep ReLU Networks</h3>
							This project involved the development of techniques to deduce the weights, biases, and architecture of deep ReLU networks 
							solely from input-output queries, without prior assumptions about their structure. 
							This is a <a href="https://github.com/MehrabHamidi99/ReverseEngineeringNetworks">github page</a> which you can find the code and 
							the relevant document.
						</li>
						<li> 
							<h3>Likelihood-Free Method for Estimating Trait Phenotype Posterior Distributions</h3>
							We aimed to identify causal SNPs and predict phenotypes for specific traits using likelihood-free Bayesian methods. 
							The research also extended to applications in Longitudinal Genome-wide Association Studies.
						</li>
						<li> 
							<h3>Enhancing Variable Selection for Categorical Data Using the Knockoff Method</h3>
							This study focuses on improving the performance and applicability of variable selection methods for categorical data, 
							specifically through the enhancement of the Knockoff method.
